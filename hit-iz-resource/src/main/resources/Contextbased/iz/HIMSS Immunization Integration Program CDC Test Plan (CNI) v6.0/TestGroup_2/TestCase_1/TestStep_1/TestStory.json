For example, twins living in the same household will have similar dates of birth, addresses, and may have similar names. EHRs or other clinical software must be able to store information to successfully match with patients in immunization registries, if the information is available. The information includes the mother's maiden name, whether the patient was part of a multiple birth, and the order of the multiple birth. This information allows the provider to correctly identify the patient and also helps assure a match when the EHR send the patient's information to external systems such as an immunization registry.</p>\r\n",
