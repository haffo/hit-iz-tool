  "teststorydesc" : "A child, James T McCoy, is brought to the local clinic to determine what immunizations have been given and what immunizations are needed. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider uses this information to locate the patient's medical record. The staff member then uses the medical record and system capabilities to query the IIS to request an evaluated history and forecast for the patient.\r\n<br/>\r\nThe IIS performs a search for James T McCoy and finds too many matches. The IIS returns a response message indicating no person found (too many matches) to the querying system. It is expected that the requesting system (e.g., EHR-S) process the response message and display some indication to the end user that the person was not found (too many matches).\r\n<br/>\r\nThis test evaluates the ability of the EHR-S to gracefully accept a response where too many matches are found, based on the parameters sent in the query. Note that this query only expects an evaluated history and forecast when an exact match is found.",
