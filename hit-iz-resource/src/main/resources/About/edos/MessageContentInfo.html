	<h3>How to Interpret the Message Content Tab and
		Its Implications on Testing</h3>
	<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 0.21in">
		The Message Content Data Sheet indicates the data that are to be
		included in the test message based on the test data entered into the
		Health IT Module for a particular Test Step. The information in the <i><b>Location
		</b></i>column indicates the canonical element location in the HL7 V2 message.
		For example, PID-3.5 represents the 5th component in the 3rd field of
		the PID segment. The <i><b>Data Element</b></i> column indicates the
		name of the data element as specified by the Messaging Guide. The <i><b>Test
				Data</b></i> column lists the data to be included for each Data Element in
		the message created by the Health IT Module.
	</p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 0.21in">
		The <i><b>Categorization</b></i> column indicates the type and
		expected source of the data as well as how the Context-based feature
		in the Tool will validate the data for the given Data Element in the
		message. In some cases the test tool validator simply examines the
		message element for the presence of data, whereas in other cases the
		validator examines the message element for the presence of data and
		for exact content.
	</p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 0.21in">
		<a name="_GoBack"></a> <b>Table 1</b> shows descriptions of the test
		data Categories and their associated Qualifiers. The test data
		categories enable classification of the test data in order to extend
		and strengthen the rigor of the testing. Each classification category
		defines the criteria that are used by the test tool to assess the test
		data that populate each field in a message. These criteria in turn
		tell the tester whether or not the test data in a specific field can
		be changed, the source of the test data, and to what level of
		precision the validation tool will assess the data. A common example
		for extending the testing capability involves message elements
		specified with a Usage of RE (Required, but maybe Empty).
		Context-based testing must be used when the Tester wishes to assess
		the system's ability to support these elements, because without
		context (test data provided) an automated validation tool has "limited
		ways of knowing" whether the data for the RE data element are
		available for use in the message or not. Using a test case and
		associated categorized test data, the Tester can inform the validation
		tool (and the user) of the conformance expectations for this message
		element. In the case of assessing a system's capability for support of
		an element with RE usage, the category assigned would be "Presence",
		which notifies the Tester and validation tool that data shall be
		present for this message element.

		The <b>Test Data Categories</b> provide a classification scheme for
		defining how the test data given in a test case impact the validation
		of message instances. The use of test data expands the scope of
		message validation. For each test case, test data are given that
		coincide with the test story. The test case developer uses the test
		case categories to assess vendor capabilities required by the
		implementation guide in the context-based testing operation mode (such
		requirements can't easily be tested in a context-free environment).
		The <b>Qualifier</b> (<b>Table 2</b>) provides a refinement of the
		test data category and provides additional information of the source
		and expectations of the data element. The qualifier does not impact
		the validation of the data element.
	</p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The test data
		categories apply only to data elements with R (Require) and RE
		(Required, but may be Empty) usages. Data elements with usages of O
		(Optional) and X (Not-supported) are not considered for this testing.
		In the future they may be considered, for example, to assess the
		receiver's capability to react to messages with errors, and X elements
		will be valued (and a test data category of Error will be created).
		Elements with C (Conditional) usages resolve to either R, RE, O, or X
		usages based on the outcome of the condition predicate. The test case
		developer will provide (or not provide) data to trigger the various
		outcomes. Hence, data elements with C usage for a specific test case
		resolve to another usage and are handled as described above for that
		specific usage.</p>
